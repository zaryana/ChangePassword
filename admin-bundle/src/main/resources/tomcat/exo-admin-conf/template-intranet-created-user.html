<p>3.You can start working on a project by creating a space and trying the different available tools, like sharing documents, creating wiki pages, or setting up a forum.</p>
<p>4.And finally, the most important part of all: your opinion! What features did you find most valuable, and which ones did you dislike? Did you find any bugs? We want to know what you think.</p>

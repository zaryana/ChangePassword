<p>Hi <b>${first.name},</b></p>
<p>Congrats, we hand-picked you to be one of the very first beta-testers for Cloud Workspaces! Your participation will have a direct impact on helping us improve and shape the direction of the product.  Your workspace is now available here: <a href="http://${tenant.repository.name}.${tenant.masterhost}">http://${tenant.repository.name}.${tenant.masterhost}</a></p>
<p>Here's how to get started:</p>
<ol>
<li>When you first connect, spend a few minutes going through the "Getting Started" steps listed on the homepage and start inviting some colleagues. You will have administrative privileges for the ${tenant.repository.name} workspace and you will receive notification of each new user added.</li>
<li>You can start working on a project by creating a space and trying the different available tools, like sharing documents, creating wiki pages, or setting up a forum.</li>
<li>And finally, the most important part of all: your opinion! What features did you find most valuable, and which ones did you dislike? Did you find any bugs? We want to know what you think.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can send us your feedback at any time by simply replying to this email (beta@cloud-workspaces.com), or by using the "contact us" link on <a href="http://cloud-workspaces.com">cloud-workspaces.com</a>.</p>
<p>Ready to get started? Join the <a href="http://${tenant.repository.name}.${tenant.masterhost}">${tenant.repository.name}  workspace</a>.</p>

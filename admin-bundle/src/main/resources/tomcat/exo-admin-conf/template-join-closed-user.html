<p>Hello,</p>

<p>We received a request to create a Cloud Workspaces account for <b>${user.mail}</b>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately <b>${tenant.repository.name}</b> has already reached the maximum number of users allowed.</p>
<p>In order to proceed to your registration, the administrator of the  <b>${tenant.repository.name}</b> workspace needs to increase the maximum number of users allowed.</p>
<p>We have informed him how to proceed. When this is done done, we will sign you up on <b>${tenant.repository.name}</b> workspaces.</a></p>
<br/>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>The Cloud Workspaces team</p>

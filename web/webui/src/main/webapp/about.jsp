          <h3>Cloud Workspaces: Your Company's Social Intranet in the Cloud</h3>
          <p>Cloud Workspaces is a free cloud-based social intranet. It provides tools that let you capture, organize and act on your team's internal knowledge, from a full-featured enterprise wiki, powerful document management system, forums, calendars and more.
          </p>
          <p>Cloud Workspaces lets you go beyond the basic chatter of activity streams, giving employees the tools to customize their working environment. Individual users can create personalized dashboards to act as the starting point for all their online work, while teams and projects can have their own dedicated workspace to connect, share resources and collaborate. Finally, developers can build and deploy custom apps with the embedded web-based IDE.
          </p>
